*** Atarenium Falcon ***

1. INTRODUCTION

    Atarenium Falcon is a simple, let's say, "puzzle-solving" game for Commodore Amiga. 
    Written using C language and Amiga C Engine. 
    It's my first bigger project, started to improve my basic programming 
    skills (still lot to learn).

2. REQUIREMENTS

    Minimum: any Commodore Amiga with 1Mb Chip Ram and KS2.05 up. Best to play from HDD instead of DF0: or .adf, due to loading time comfort.
    To install on HDD simply copy the content from floppy or .adf into chosen drawer. 

3. GAMEPLAY AND CONTROLS

    Navigate the Falcon using Joystick, WSAD or Arrow keys and lead it to the Atari Portal. 
    Collect the coal - that's your fuel to continue the flight.
    Remember to keep at least 1 coal in primary tank at the end of the level.
    Excess amount of coal will be transferred to the secondary tank
    at the end of each level and will raise your endgame score.
    Consider collecting blue and capacitors to raise endgame score too.
    Also consider collecting the Robbo's for additional informations.

    Pressing 'M' key turns the music on/off.

    There are three 3-letter cheatcodes hidden in the game, as stated in credits. 
    Try typing them at the menu screen. One gives you unlimited fuel (coal),
    another one changes some graphics and turns the game into "Amiga-mode",
    while third one lets you skip levels by pressing 'N' key during game. 

4. GAME INTRO 

    1. - tl;dr, lol

    If you're both Amiga and Atari enthusiast you have the unique chance to infiltrate 
    your Amiga with our special Atari-inspired spaceship.

    If you're hardcore Amiga enthusiast that will use Atari only to plow the field 
    or throw it directly to the water from Golden Gate, I still have something for you -
    maybe you will discover the alternative ending and lead the Amigans to the glory?

    2. - some background for conservative Amigans and Atarimens of the planet Earth:

    Since early demo versions I've noticed comments like "wtf Atari logo in Amiga game" etc.
    The game is settled (hopefully in funny way) in the middle of the old democene-like 'confilct', 
    where both  Atari and Amiga users were arguing, or even fighting, 
    to prove their computer is the best one.
    Why not make some fun out of it? 
    Are you on Atari side? Try getting a homeless Amiga, insert this 'Atari trojan horse' 
    into it and find out if you can beat the Amigans' part of universe.
    Amiga rulez? So as mentioned above - you can try turning things around and crush
    the Atarimens dreams by joining the Amiga side of power along the way
    (hey, you're smart, you prefer Amiga, you can do it).

    If you can't stand the Atari logo on your Amiga screen and it makes you sick,
    then this game is just not for you. Sorry.
