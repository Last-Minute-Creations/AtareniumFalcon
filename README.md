*** Atarenium Falcon ***

1. INTRODUCTION

    Atarenium Falcon is a simple, let's say, "puzzle-solving" game for Commodore Amiga. 
    Written using C language and Amiga C Engine. 
    It's my first bigger project, started to improve my basic programming 
    skills (still lot to learn).

2. REQUIREMENTS

    Minimum: any Commodore Amiga with kickstart 2.05 or higher.

3. GAMEPLAY AND CONTROLS

    Navigate the Falcon using Joystick, WSAD or Arrow keys and lead it to the Atari Portal. 
    Collect the coal - that's your fuel to continue the flight.
    Remember to keep at least 1 coal in primary tank at the end of the level.
    Excess amount of coal will be transferred to the secondary tank
    at the end of each level and will raise your endgame score.
    Consider collecting blue and capacitors to raise endgame score too.
    Also consider collecting the Robbo's for additional informations.

    Pressing 'M' key turns the music on/off.

4. GAME INTRO - tl;dr, lol

    If you're both Amiga and Atari enthusiast you have the unique chance to infiltrate 
    your Amiga with our special Atari-inspired spaceship.

    If you're hardcore Amiga enthusiast that will use Atari only to plow the field 
    or throw it directly to the water from Golden Gate, I still have something for you -
    maybe you will discover the alternative ending and lead the Amigans to the glory?
